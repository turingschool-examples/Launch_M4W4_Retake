# Week 4 Assessment

### Setup
* Fork and clone this repository
* Open your forked repo in Visual Studio.
* Complete the two exercises and the questions

## Exercise 1: Inheritance and Dependency Injection (8 points)

Open up `Program.cs` and run your program. It should run with no errors, if you get an error reach out to your instructor.

This exercise involves some refactoring and some new features.

**Step 1:** Currently there are two classess `Student` and `Teacher` that have a lot of repeated code between them. Create a new class `Person` that will be the base class. Then update `Student` and `Teacher` to be derived from `Person`. Include as much in your `Person` class as you can to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). 

**Testing Step 1:** Uncomment the code under "Step 1:" in the Main method. That code should now run without error.

**Step 2:** Implement a new class called `School` that uses dependency injection and takes in a list of people as a dependency. Implement a method called `ListBirthdays` in your school class that calls the `GetBirthday` method and prints to the console each student and teacher's birthday.

**Testing Step 2:** Uncomment the code under "Step 2:" in the Main method. That code should now run without error and output a bunch of names and birthdays.

Ungraded extra challenge: If you have time, improve the way the birthdays are output. Can you group them by month or by Student/Teacher?

### Exercise 2: Interfaces (4 points)
Open up `InterfacePractice.cs`. You should not need to run this file, you will just edit it.

**Step 1:** Take a look at the two classes `Car` and `Bicycle`. They both implement an interface called `InterfaceNameHere`. Replace all three uses of `InterfaceNameHere` with a fitting name for this interface.

**Step 2:** The interface has already been created for you on line 5. Fill in the details for any methods and/or properties that make sense based on the two classes implementing this interface.

## Questions (8 points)

Edit this file with your answers.

1. What are some of the benefits of using inheritance? (1 point)
    * < Your answer >  
2. What might be some of the disadvantages of using inheritance? (1 point)
    * < Your answer >  

3. How would you describe the difference between the base class and the derived class when working with inheritance? (1 point)
	* < Your answer >  

4.  What happens if you define the same method in the parent class and the child class? (1 point)
	* < Your answer > 

5. In your own words, how would you define an Interface? (1 point)
    * < Your answer > 

6. Does a class implementing an interface need to implement all of the methods in that interface? Why or why not? (1 point)
    * < Your answer > 

7. Both Inheritance and Interfaces use the `:` symbol after a class name. If you're looking at a class, what's one thing that can help you determine if the class is implementing an interface of extending a base class? (1 point)
	* < Your answer >  

8. If asked in an interview, how would you describe the purpose of the IOC container in a .NET application? (1 point)
	* < Your answer >
